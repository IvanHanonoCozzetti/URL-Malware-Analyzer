# URL-Malware-Analyzer

Security tool that scans URLs and predicts if they are malicious or not.
The prediction is based on a list of URLs, the respective labels(there is an extensive amount of lists available online that can be used) and the **Logistic Regression algorithm model (scikit learn)**.

## Vectorization
Vectorization is the general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors. This specific strategy (**tokenization, counting and normalization**) is called the Bag of Words or “Bag of n-grams” representation. Documents are described by word occurrences while completely ignoring the relative position information of the words in the document.

#### `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`
Text Analysis is a major application field for machine learning algorithms. However the raw data, a sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves as most of them expect numerical feature vectors with a fixed size rather than the raw text documents with variable length.
